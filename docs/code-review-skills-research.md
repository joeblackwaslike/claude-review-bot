# Skill Recommendations: Claude LLM GitHub Code Review Bot

## Context

The project `/Users/joeblack/github/joeblackwaslike/claude-review-bot` is an empty repo being bootstrapped as a GitHub bot that uses Claude to perform automated code review on PRs. This document maps every installed skill relevant to GitHub code review across two dimensions: (1) skills the bot should invoke **during a review**, and (2) skills to use **while building the bot**.

## Recommended Skill Set

### Tier 1 — Core (use on every PR review)

1. **`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`** — Primary review agent. Confidence-filtered output reduces comment noise, which is critical for a bot that shouldn't spam.
2. **`pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`** — Error handling is the most common production defect class; this catches what static analysis misses.
3. **`pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`** — Test coverage gaps with criticality scores give actionable, prioritized feedback.
4. **`security-scanning:security-sast`** — SAST for every PR is the baseline security gate; integrates Semgrep/CodeQL which are GitHub-native.

### Tier 2 — Configurable (enable per repo or PR type)

5. **`pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer`** — Enable for TypeScript/Python typed repos; skip for dynamic-language repos without types.
6. **`pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer`** — Enable for codebases with documentation standards; adds latency so gate behind config flag.
7. **`comprehensive-review:security-auditor`** — Enable for PRs touching auth, payments, PII, or infrastructure. Heavier than SAST alone.
8. **`comprehensive-review:architect-review`** — Enable only for PRs with large scope (schema changes, new services, API boundary changes).

### Tier 3 — Build-time (use while developing the bot itself)

9. **`claude-api:claude-api`** — Essential for implementing the Anthropic SDK integration: prompt caching (critical for review cost), tool use, streaming output to GitHub comments.
10. **`superpowers:requesting-code-review`** + **`superpowers:receiving-code-review`** — Meta-skills for the bot's own CI review loop during development.
11. **`security-scanning:sast-configuration`** — Configure Semgrep/CodeQL rules the bot will invoke as subprocess tools.
12. **`git-pr-workflows:git-workflow`** — Understand the PR lifecycle the bot hooks into (webhook events, diff fetching, comment APIs).

### Skip

- **`pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`** (command) — Designed as an interactive Claude Code command; the bot replaces this orchestration layer with its own GitHub webhook handler.
- **`comprehensive-review:full-review`** (command) — Same issue; the 5-phase interactive checkpoint flow doesn't map to async bot execution.
- **`security-scanning:security-hardening`** — Remediation-focused, not review-focused; wrong phase for a PR bot.
- **`git-pr-workflows:code-reviewer`** (agent) — Overlaps heavily with `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`; keep one.

---

## Key Technical Notes

- **Prompt caching is mandatory** for a review bot — each PR diff reviewed against a system prompt means repeated context. The `claude-api` skill covers this.
- **Confidence filtering** (80+ threshold in `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`) is the primary knob to control bot comment volume. Start conservative.
- **Agent dispatch pattern**: the bot's review handler should act as its own orchestrator, dispatching Tier 1 agents in parallel via the Anthropic API's tool use pattern, then merging outputs.
- **SAST subprocess pattern**: `security-sast` guidance shows running Semgrep/Bandit as subprocesses and feeding results to Claude for triage — the bot should adopt this hybrid approach.

---

## Optimal Composition

After comparing all internal and external skills, this is the set that composes most cleanly without redundancy.

### The orchestration pattern: adopt from `moltenbits/github-pr-review`

Don't use it as a runtime skill — it's designed for interactive Claude Code sessions. Use it as the **blueprint** for the bot's GitHub posting layer:

- **Pending draft reviews** — never post directly; always create a draft the human submits
- **Batch all comments** into one review object, not individual API calls
- **` ```suggestion ` blocks** for one-click fixes where the fix is unambiguous
- **P0–P3 severity taxonomy** with 80% confidence threshold as the output contract

This gives the bot a consistent, low-noise GitHub UX that survives across every agent that produces findings.

### The agent layer: 5 skills run in parallel

| Skill | Source | Why it's in and not cut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`** | installed | Project-standard compliance (reads CLAUDE.md), confidence-filtered bugs. Moltenbits' agents don't read your coding standards — this one does. |
| **`pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`** | installed | Test coverage gap analysis with criticality scores. Not covered by any other skill in this set. |
| **`pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`** | installed | Error handling and swallowed exceptions. Moltenbits has an Error Handling agent but this one is deeper and more systematic. Overlap is acceptable because false negatives here are expensive. |
| **`security-scanning:security-sast`** | installed | Runs Semgrep/Bandit/CodeQL as **subprocesses** and feeds results to Claude for triage. This is qualitatively different from an LLM security agent — it catches known CVE patterns and injection vectors the LLM may miss. |
| **`addyosmani/code-review-and-quality`** | external (20K ★) | The 5-axis checklist (Nit/Optional/FYI) is the best available structured review framework. Complements rather than duplicates the P0–P3 severity taxonomy: axis labels map to priority, severity labels map to urgency. |

**Why not include `dyad:multi-pr-review` or `feiskyer/github-review-pr`?** Both are alternative orchestration patterns, not component agents. Their best ideas — randomized agent ordering, per-issue 0–100 confidence scoring, merge verdict, deduplication — are patterns to steal and implement in the bot's own merge layer, not separate skills to invoke.

### The merge layer: adopt patterns from `dyad:multi-pr-review`

After the 5 agents run in parallel, the bot's own merge step should:

1. Deduplicate findings across agents (same line, same issue type = one comment)
2. Resolve conflicts (e.g., agent A flags a pattern, agent B approves it) by taking the more conservative finding
3. Emit a merge verdict: **APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT** based on whether any P0 or P1 findings survived deduplication

### Build-time skills (developing the bot itself)

| Skill | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`claude-api:claude-api`** | installed | Prompt caching (critical — system prompt is reused on every PR), tool use for structured output, streaming. |
| **`altinukshini/claude-code-pr-reviewer`** | external | Reference architecture for the GitHub Action wrapper — how to wire webhooks, handle diffs, post reviews. Study the implementation; don't run it as a skill. |

### What to skip and why

| Skipped | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` | TypeScript/Python-only; add as opt-in per repo config |
| `pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer` | Adds latency for marginal signal on a webhook bot; opt-in for repos with doc standards |
| `comprehensive-review:security-auditor` | Overlaps with `security-sast` + `code-review-and-quality` security axis; too heavy for every PR |
| `comprehensive-review:architect-review` | Right idea for large PRs but the interactive checkpoint model doesn't work in async webhook context |
| `moltenbits/github-pr-review` (as runtime skill) | Use as pattern source only; its orchestration model assumes interactive Claude Code |
| `axisrow/cycle-review` | Excellent for a loop-bot product but a separate use case from a one-shot review bot |

---

## Verification

After implementation, validate with:
1. Submit a test PR to a sandboxed repo and confirm webhook fires
2. Verify each Tier 1 skill produces output (no silent agent failures)
3. Check GitHub comment formatting (markdown renders, no JSON leaking)
4. Measure token usage per review; confirm cache hit rate > 80% on the system prompt
5. Submit a PR with a known SQL injection and verify `security-sast` catches it
