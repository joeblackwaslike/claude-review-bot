features:
  - icon: 🔀
    title: Five agents, one review
    details: Bug detection, error handling, test coverage, security, and code quality agents run in parallel via Promise.allSettled(). Their findings are merged and deduplicated before posting — same line flagged twice becomes one comment.

  - icon: 🛡️
    title: Conservative by design
    details: When two agents disagree on severity, the more conservative finding wins. The final verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES if any agent surfaced a blocking issue, COMMENT otherwise. No false approvals.

  - icon: 📌
    title: Diff-anchored comments
    details: Every inline comment is validated against the actual diff before submission. Comments referencing lines not in the diff are dropped silently — the bot never errors a review over a bad anchor.

  - icon: 💬
    title: Slash-command triggered
    details: Comment /claude-review on any PR. Pass inline instructions — "/claude-review focus on the auth flow" — for targeted deep-dives. Re-run with --force to re-review the same commit.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: Deploy in minutes
    details: Fork, link to Vercel, set 5 env vars, deploy. Works with any GitHub repo your app is installed on. No infrastructure to manage beyond the GitHub App itself.

  - icon: 🔧
    title: Pluggable skill frameworks
    details: Each agent's review framework is a vendored Markdown file in skills/. Add a new framework by dropping in a .md file and adding one line to AGENT_SKILLS in review.ts.
